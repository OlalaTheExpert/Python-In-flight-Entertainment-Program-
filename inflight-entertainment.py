#
# Users on longer flights like to start a second movie right when their
# first one ends, but they complain that the plane usually lands before
# they can see the ending. So you're building a feature for choosing two
# movies whose total runtimes will equal the exact flight length.
#
# Write a function that takes an integer flight_length (in minutes) and
# a list of integers movie_lengths (in minutes) and returns a boolean
# indicating whether there are two numbers in movie_lengths whose sum
# equals flight_length.
#
# When building your function:
#
# + Assume your users will watch exactly two movies
# + Don't make your users watch the same movie twice
# + Optimize for runtime over memory

# Now my turn

        # put each length of a movie into a hash table as we scan over
        # all the movies (by length) see if the complement movie is
        # already in lengths.  by the time we reach the end of the
        # movies by lengths every movie has been checked for its
